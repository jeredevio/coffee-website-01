# Coffee Time ☕️

A simple landing page for a fictional café.  
Built to solidify my understanding of HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.

## 🎯 What I practiced

- Layout structure with HTML  
- Styling with CSS and TailwindCSS  
- Responsive design  
- Basic interactivity (JS burger menu)

## 🚀 Demo
